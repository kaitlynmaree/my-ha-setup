# Overview
I've always loved the idea of a super high-tech automated home, straight out of the movies - but as a broke uni student, I make do with ESP32's and a server instead!

## Skills
- Systems Integration & IoT: Configured WiFi-based automation and device control using YAML and Python scripting
- Embedded Systems: Deployeed and optimised **Home Assistant OS** on a local server.
- Networking & Communication Protocols: Integrated multiple smart devices using MQTT, Zigbee and API-based communications.
- Diagnosed and resolved compatibility issues with software and hardware components. 
- Custom dashboard with visual elements for monitoring and control

# Hardware
My Home Assistance instance is running in a Docker environment on a HP Prodesk 600 G3.

## Network
I use Zigbee and Wifi as communication protocols. 
With the help of [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/), I have a cheap stable network. 
I use an off-the-shelf Eero mesh WiFi network
# Future Plans
- Energy Monitoring - track and optimise home power consumption
